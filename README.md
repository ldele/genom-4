**Genomic project**

====================

This project aims to perform different operations linked to biological computing such as processing data in a genom. It is able to analyse genomic sequences in order to find a specific motif which can be linked by transcription factors.

In this project, the Position Weight Matrix (PWM) is the mathematical model used when dealing with data. It contains information about the probability and the frequency of each nucleotide in the motif. Therefore, the program is also able to retrieve the PWM starting from a bedfile.

The program has to be compiled with cmake (required versionÂ : 2.8.1).
